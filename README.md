This is a project created with React Redux Starter Kit.  
The purpose of which is to hold simple components performing basic operations for future reference.  
Simplicity is key here:  
Many references online are buried in mountains of extraneous code which has little to no effect on the primary function being demonstrated.  
Styling, Insignificant Optimizations, Remnants of Templates etc often serve to bury the pertinent information.    
Components will perform a single function or a small set of closely associated functions to be described in the sections below.    
The added components will all exist under src / routes .

Components Present :  
Ordinal Suffix [ Input , Applies appropriate ordinal suffix to inputted number ]  
Mapping [ Maps out an array that is present in initial state ]  
Filtering [ Submit numbers into an array , Displays : Array , Evens , Odds ]  
Finding [ User input is tested against an array and a string, displays position if found]  
    Case Insensitive version also present here  
RecursiveSoring - Based off of exercises in Brian Holts Computer Science Lectures on Front End Masters  
    Present here as both a useful reference on simple recursive functions and practice for visualizing array sorting methods.  
    [ User submits numbers into an array , Presses the button for Bubble Merge or Quick sort and the array is sorted via the chosen method and displayed on the page .]
